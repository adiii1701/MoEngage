      "assessment": "The content is written at a college level, which may be challenging for non-technical marketers. Technical terminology is prevalent throughout, and some concepts assume prior knowledge of Android development. The writing style is instructional but could benefit from more explanatory context for marketing personas.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Define 'FCM' (Firebase Cloud Messaging) when first mentioned - many marketers may not be familiar with this acronym",
        "Replace 'SDK integration' with 'adding MoEngage tools to your app' for clearer understanding",
        "Add a brief explanation of what push notifications achieve from a marketing perspective",
        "Consider adding a glossary section for technical terms",
        "Break down the 127-word paragraph in the 'Configuration' section into smaller, digestible chunks"

      "assessment": "The article follows a logical progression from basic setup to advanced configuration. The heading structure is mostly well-organized, though there's one hierarchy gap. The use of code blocks and lists helps break up dense technical content. Navigation could be improved with a table of contents.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a table of contents at the beginning for easier navigation",
        "Consider adding estimated time requirements for each major section",
        "Include a 'Quick Start' section for experienced developers",
        "Add cross-references between related sections (e.g., link from basic setup to troubleshooting)",

      "assessment": "The article provides comprehensive technical implementation details with multiple code examples. However, it lacks context about the marketing benefits and use cases for the features described. Some error scenarios are covered, but more real-world examples would be valuable.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Add examples of effective push notification campaigns that marketers can reference",
        "Include common error messages and their solutions in a dedicated troubleshooting section",

      "assessment": "The content follows technical documentation standards but could be more action-oriented and customer-focused. Some sections use passive voice, and the tone is quite formal. The writing assumes technical expertise and doesn't always guide the user through the 'why' behind each step.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Replace passive constructions: 'Notifications can be customized' → 'Customize your notifications by...'",
        "Add benefit statements after technical steps: explain why each configuration matters",
        "Use more imperative mood: 'You should configure' → 'Configure the following settings'",
        "Include success indicators: tell users what they should see after completing each step"

      "suggestions": [
        "Define 'segmentation' with a practical example when first introduced",
        "Explain 'A/B testing' benefits in marketing terms rather than just feature description",
